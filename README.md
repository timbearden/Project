#### First Read: Clinton Has Owned the Airwaves in the General Election
Exactly two months ago, Hillary Clinton's campaign went up with its first general election TV ads in battleground states, and in that time it has spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-Clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million. What is Trump doing with his campaign money (after the New York Times reported two weeks ago that Trump and the GOP had raised a combined $82 million last month)? Oh, and get this: The Green Party's Jill Stein ($189,000) and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson ($15,000) have spent more on ads than the Trump campaign ($0) in this general election.

Trump outside groups: $12.4 million
Total Team Trump: $12.4 million

Clinton 50%, Trump 41%: Meanwhile, the latest weekly national NBC.SurveyMonkey online tracking poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by nine points, 50%-41% -- virtually unchanged from last week's 51%-41% advantage for Clinton. Just 17 percent of all voters say that Trump has the personality and temperament to serve effectively as president. Even among Republican and Republican-leaners, only 19 percent said Trump has the personality to serve effectively. "[T]he national security framework he described was so contradictory and filled with so many obvious falsehoods that it's virtually impossible to tell what he would do as president… That's because Trump previously supported every single foreign policy decision he now decries. Despite claiming daily that he opposed the Iraq War from the start, Trump endorsed deposing Saddam Hussein in a 2002 interview and there's no record of him opposing the war until after it had began. Hillary Clinton holds a voter-registration even in Philadelphia at 1:15 pm ET… Tim Kaine hits North Carolina… Donald Trump holds a rally in West Bend, WI at 8:30 pm ET… And Mike Pence is in New Mexico.
